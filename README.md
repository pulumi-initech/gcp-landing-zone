# Multi-Cloud Landing Zones with Pulumi

This project demonstrates a comprehensive multi-cloud landing zone implementation using Pulumi across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It follows cloud-native best practices and implements standardized governance, security, and monitoring across all three major cloud providers.

## Architecture Overview

The landing zone architecture implements the following components for each cloud:

  landing-zones:orgName: YourOrgName
  landing-zones:aws.enabled: true
  landing-zones:azure.enabled: true
  landing-zones:gcp.enabled: true
```

## Required Permissions

### AWS
- **Existing AWS Organization**: This demo assumes you have an existing AWS Organization
- Organizations full access
- Account creation permissions
- IAM permissions for policy and role creation
- VPC and networking permissions
- CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, and Security Hub permissions

## Deployment

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure cloud providers** (ensure all CLIs are authenticated):
   ```bash
   aws configure
   az login
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. **Set Pulumi configuration**:
   ```bash
   pulumi config set orgName "YourOrgName"
   pulumi config set aws.enabled true
   pulumi config set aws.organizationRootId "r-xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Your AWS Organization root ID
   pulumi config set azure.enabled true
   pulumi config set gcp.enabled true
   pulumi config set billingAccount "XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX"  # Your GCP billing account ID
   ```

   **To find your AWS Organization Root ID:**
   ```bash
   aws organizations list-roots --query 'Roots[0].Id' --output text
   ```

   **To find your GCP Billing Account ID:**
   ```bash
   gcloud billing accounts list --format="value(name)"
   ```

4. **Deploy the landing zones**:
   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

5. **Configure GCP Shared VPC (manual step)**:
   After deployment, enable Shared VPC manually:
   ```bash
   # Enable the networking project as a Shared VPC host
   gcloud compute shared-vpc enable [NETWORKING_PROJECT_ID]
   
   # Associate service projects with the host project
   gcloud compute shared-vpc associated-projects add [PROD_PROJECT_ID] --host-project [NETWORKING_PROJECT_ID]
   gcloud compute shared-vpc associated-projects add [DEV_PROJECT_ID] --host-project [NETWORKING_PROJECT_ID]
   ```

security.gcp              // GCP security resource IDs
```

## Customization

To customize the landing zones for your organization:

1. **Modify configuration** in `Pulumi.dev.yaml`
2. **Update component resources** in respective cloud directories
3. **Adjust security policies** in the shared security components
4. **Customize monitoring** dashboards and alerts
5. **Add additional compliance** rules as needed

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each cloud provider has its own component
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in code
- **Security First**: Security controls implemented from day one
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring setup
- **Cost Management**: Resource tagging and cost allocation
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region and cross-cloud resilience

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure all required permissions are granted
2. **Quota Limits**: Check cloud provider quotas for organizations/projects
3. **DNS Resolution**: Verify custom domain ownership for organizations
4. **Network Conflicts**: Ensure CIDR blocks don't overlap between clouds
